# small-projects
These is where I'm putting my short and sweet projects. I'm mainly writing these as I begin to learn to code. Thank you for downloading this program! This is my first time programming in Python in a while. It's a nice and easy one, so I hope you like it. This file contains a .py file and a .exe file to run said code, and a readable version of the code as well. Enjoy! :)
